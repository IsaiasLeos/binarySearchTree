# binarySearchTree
For this lab we are reviewing how binary search trees worked and implement certain different methods to create binary trees
from sorted arrays, order it, and create sorted arrays from binary search trees.
There were given methods for us to use and to understand how the binary search trees work and how to properly manipulate
them to help us progress with the lab. 
We are also learning different ways to search binary search trees, recursively and iteratively, and print the nodes
at a certain depth of the tree.
